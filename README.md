# midway_pic_tool
Tool to read and (optionally) modify serial number and/or date from PIC16F57 dump used in many Atari/Midway games  
by Pat Daderko (DogP) based on MAME midway_serial_pic_device::generate_serial_data from midwayic.cpp by Aaron Giles  

**Usage:** midway_pic_tool <filename> [new SN (0-999999999)] [new MM (1-12)] [new DD (0-30)] [new YYYY (1980-2155)]  
Enter '-' to leave parameter unchanged

Repository includes C source code and precompiled Windows executable.

**NOTES:**
* Entering new values modifies original file  
* KLOV user neSneSgB successfully tested this tool, though noted that SF Rush 2049 SE errored on boot with "IOASIC PROBLEM" if the first 3 digits of the S/N were changed.
* neSneSgB also confirmed the day field displays as 0-30 instead of 1-31 (for the Rush games at least).
